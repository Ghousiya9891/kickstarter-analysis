# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

**Lousie** and upcoming playwright wants to fund her play **FEVER** by using crowdfunding campaign. She estmates a budget of $10000 and is primarily focussed in US and Great Britain market campaign funding for plays based on the launch date. As a data analyst by using powerfull tool *Excel* a deep dive of crowd funding data analysis and visualization is provided to Lousie to determine the specific parameters that would help her in raising fund to her startup drama production.

### Purpose

Based on the statistical data distribution and outcomes visualized in respect to launch date and cateogory of the campaigns organized Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short span of time. She now wants to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
This can be determined by visualizing data pertaining to campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

By implementing the analysis techniques provided by Excel following inferences are derived on the Outcomes based on
    -Launch Date
    -Goals of Funding

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To determine the outcomes based on the Launch date the number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes are visualized by grouping against months of the year. The following graph is plotted by using Pivot table to determine total number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes based on Launch date and filtering the group funding data with Parent Category as *Theatre* and years of campaign launch.

The below graph visualizes the total number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes plotted against the each month. From the below graph it is clearly interpreted that maximum number of successful kickstarter outcomes are seen in June and May months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To determine the outcomes based on the Goals 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
